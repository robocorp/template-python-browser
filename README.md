# Template: Python - Browser automation with Playwright

This template leverages the new python open-source structure [robo](https://github.com/robocorp/robo), the [libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robo#libraries) from to same project as well.

The template provides you with the basic structure of a Python project: logging out of the box and controlling your tasks without fiddling with the base Python stuff. The environment contains the most used libraries, so you do not have to start thinking about those right away. 
With `robocorp-browser`, the browser automation uses Playwright without any extra steps. 

👉 After running the bot, check out the `log.html` under the `output` -folder.

The template contains simple Browser automation that solves the [RPA Form Challenge](https://www.rpachallenge.com). This includes Excel data reading and interacting with a web site.

🚀 Now, you can just get to writing.
